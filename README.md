🚀 Introduction:
The GitHub to Jira Automation project is designed to revolutionize the workflow of software development teams by seamlessly integrating GitHub issues with Jira, streamlining the process of task management and issue tracking. By automating the creation of Jira tickets from GitHub issues, this project aims to enhance productivity, reduce manual effort, and facilitate smoother collaboration among team members.

🔧 Technologies Used:
1. Python: The project is developed using Python, a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
2. Flask: Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, is utilized to build the web application, providing a robust and flexible foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses.
3. GitHub Webhooks: Leveraging GitHub webhooks allows the application to listen for specific events on GitHub, such as issue comments, enabling seamless integration and real-time communication between GitHub and the application.
4. Jira Dashboard: Jira serves as the central platform for managing project tasks and issues, providing comprehensive features for agile project management, issue tracking, and collaboration.
5. AWS EC2 Linux Instance: Deployment of the application is facilitated through an AWS EC2 Linux instance, ensuring scalability, reliability, and accessibility of the application on the cloud.
6. API Creation: APIs are created using Python and Flask to facilitate communication between GitHub and Jira, enabling data exchange and interaction between the two platforms.

🛠️ Installation and Setup:
1. Python Installation: Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website.
2. Flask Installation: Install Flask using pip:
    ```
    pip install Flask
    ```
3. GitHub Webhooks Configuration: Configure GitHub webhooks to trigger the application upon specific events, such as issue comments.
4. Jira Integration: Set up Jira to receive and process incoming requests from the application, enabling seamless synchronization of tasks and issues.
5. AWS EC2 Instance Setup: Launch an AWS EC2 Linux instance and deploy the application to the cloud for accessibility and scalability.

💡 Usage:
1. GitHub Issues Identification**: Identify critical GitHub issues that require further action and tracking in Jira.
2. Automated Ticket Creation: Comment "/jira" on the relevant GitHub issue to trigger the automated process of creating a corresponding Jira ticket.
3. Streamlined Workflow: The application automatically generates a Jira ticket based on the details of the GitHub issue, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring accurate synchronization between GitHub and Jira.
